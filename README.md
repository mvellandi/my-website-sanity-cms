# Mario's Website using Sanity CMS

This is my exploration of how to build a meaningful custom CMS that meets my needs, including:

- 2 single-record assets for contact and about pages
- Projects with sections
- Articles
- Toys (links to straightforward mini projects hosted on Codepen, Github, Figma, or elsewhere)
- Categories for a project's structural aspects including: App Framework, CMS, Language, Database, Testing, etc.
